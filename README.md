# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
This repository contains my 3 mini-projects done in course CIS 731 Artificial Neural Networks:

  Backpropagation implementation, analysis and performance comparison linear vs non-linear ctivation function
  
  Implementation of neural network with demonstration of impact of FP and FN rates on performance
  
  Implementation and performance comparison of SVM, Backpropagation and LVQ2
